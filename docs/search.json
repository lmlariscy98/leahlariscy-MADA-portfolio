In the Fall of 2022 I started my graduate career by taking EPID 7500, an intro to coding in R course, which allowed me to get familiar with R studio and get comfortable doing simple analysis. I also started running the wastewater surveillance script for the Lipp Lab’s COVID-19 surveillance website in the Fall. This involved raw data from qPCR outputs which I used to estimate copies per liter of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in Athens-Clarke County wastewater influent."

For both gdpfert and fertmort, I plotted the data points using geom_point() and geom_smooth() to produce a scatter plot with a smoothed line over the data. The smoothed line helps visualize patterns in the plot.\n\n#produce scatter plot with smooth line; x = gdp, y = fertility\n#x-axis log transformed for gdp data\nggplot(gdpfert, aes(gdp, fertility))+\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth()+\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 637 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 637 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a distinct negative correlation with fertility after the GDP of a country reaches above approx. 9.7 billion dollars. Note that most African countries have a GDP between 485 million and $9.7 billion dollars where the line fluctuates around 6 children per woman.\n\n#produce scatter plot with smooth line; x = fertility, y = infant_mortality\nggplot(fertmort, aes(fertility, infant_mortality)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, fertility and infant mortality are positively correlated until approximately 7 children per woman or 125 infants deaths per 1000.\n\n\nLinear modeling\nI would like to consider a linear model predicting fertility from GDP and infant mortality for African countries. The glm() function will be used to create a linear model for this scenario. The tidy() function from the broom package produces the summary of the model.\n\nfit3 <- glm(fertility ~ gdp + infant_mortality, data = africadata)\n\ntidy(fit3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  <chr>                <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)       3.91e+ 0  5.49e- 2      71.2 0        \n2 gdp              -1.41e-11  9.62e-13     -14.7 1.45e- 46\n3 infant_mortality  2.18e- 2  4.99e- 4      43.6 4.58e-300\n\n\nBoth GDP and infant mortality has a statistically significant affect on fertility (p-values > 0.001). GDP has an extremely small negative effect on fertility (slope = -1.411e-11), and infant mortality has a small positive effect (slope = 2.176e-2)."
